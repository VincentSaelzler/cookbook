## Ingredients
✅ Boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs.  
🌡️ Ranch dressing seasoning  
🌡️ 1 cup / 100g Plain breadcrumbs  
✅ 50g Grated Parmesan Cheese  
🌡️ Mayonnaise  

## Prep Dredge
In a shallow plate, combine the ranch dressing mix with the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese.

Place the mayo in another shallow plate.

## Coat Chicken
Dredge the chicken breasts first through mayo on both sides, then through the breadcrumb mixture.

Place into the prepared baking dish.

## Bake
Bake at 190c for about 25 minutes, until a thermometer reads 155°F when inserted into the thickest part of the chicken breast.

## Next Time
Try seasoning the chicken breading with a more generic herby blend. Then make ranch sauce separately and dip the chicken in.
