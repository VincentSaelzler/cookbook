## Inspiration

[Courtney O'Dell from Sweet C's](https://sweetcsdesigns.com/the-best-smoked-pork-ribs-recipe-ever/) 

## 3 Hours Uncovered Baking
Season ribs with salt, pepper, garlic.

Bake for 3 hours at 100 on fan mode.

## 2 Hours Covered Baking
Cover with silicone and cook another 2 hours.

## 1 Hour Sauced Baking
Uncover again and coat with sauce.

If the ribs become done, it's more important to avoid overcooking than to have the sauce be "barked".

## Results
Overall good! I didn't add any liquid for the covered baking part, and also kept them in for the full time without really checking whether they were done.

## Next Time
Refer to recipe and "then cover with the cider, and butter mixture."

Watch for them to be done; don't dry them out by overcooking.
