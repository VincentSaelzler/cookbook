# Saucy Bean-Baked Eggs
Inspired by [Esther Clark from BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/saucy-bean-baked-eggs#commentsFeed)

## Ingredients
‚úÖ 2 x 400g cans cherry tomatoes  
‚úÖ 2 x 400g can mixed bean salad, drained  
‚úÖ 200g baby spinach  
ü•£ 10 eggs  
‚úÖ 100g already cooked beef, in small bits  

## Simmer
Simmer tomatoes and beans salad for 15 mins, until tomatoes no longer taste bitter.

Stir in the spinach and cook for 8 minutes, until wilted.

## Grill / Bake
Heat the grill to medium. Pour all 10 eggs on top of the bean mixture. Grill for 10 minutes, then bake on 200 fan for another 5 minutes.

## Result
‚û°Ô∏è Output: 2 Liters.

Meh. Liquidy. It is hard to tell whether the liquid is uncooked egg whites, or the tomatoes/bean salad mix.

Cooking the eggs like this doesn't work well.

## Next Time
Keep the cherry tomato + spinach base. Use regular beans instead of the bean salad. Cook the eggs separately then add to the mixture later.

Also, use ham. The saltyness will be nice. Just used beef this time because it was laying around.
