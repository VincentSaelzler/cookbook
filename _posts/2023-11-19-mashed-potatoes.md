Simply boiled and mashed.

Inspired by [Poppy O'Toole from BBC Food](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/mashedpotatoes_90230).

## Boil Potatoes
✅ 1 kg maris piper potatoes, **sliced into 1cm thick rounds**.  
✅ water to cover  
✅ about 1-2 tbsp salt

## Mash Potatoes
Drain the potatoes to a sieve. Mix and mash all ingredients in the pot.

🌡️ 80g butter  
🌡️ 200ml single cream  
✅ salt to taste  
✅ pepper to taste  

## Secrets to Success

- slice the potatoes so they boil faster

## Try next time
- use less cream and butter next time
- maybe add some herbs
- use the whole 1.5kg bag to make about 2L

## Output
➡️ Just over 1L
