## Ingredients

🔪 1 small onion diced  
✅ about 2 tablespoons butter  
✅ 600g (2x 3000g packages) sliced white mushrooms  
✅ 4 cloves worth of garlic paste  
🔪 6 sprigs fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme  
🌡️? 200ml white wine  
✅ 1 chicken bullion packet  
🌡️? 300ml single cream  
🥣 cornflour slurry as needed to thicken  
🔪 3 tablespoons fresh parsley  
🌡️ salt and pepper to taste  

## Instructions
Saute onion in butter until softened, about 3-5 minutes.

Add mushrooms, salt, and pepper. Cook until mushrooms have released juices. Add garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Add the wine to deglaze and loosen any bits off the pan and simmer a few minutes until the wine has almost evaporated.

Add the chicken broth and cream. Simmer 5 minutes or until reduced by half.

To thicken the sauce further, combine cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water (or broth) and mix well. Add cornstarch mixture into the broth a little bit at a time to reach desired consistency. You may not need all of the cornstarch mixture.

Let simmer 1 minute.

Season with parsley, salt and pepper to taste
