This takes a while. Heat is just above medium. Keep going until the fat turns to liquid.

Don't mix the uncooked liquid eggs with the pork or tofu. This kept those items crispy. The result is more of a breakfast bowl with separate ingredients as opposed to just mush.|Sauté some onions after doing the tofu. Leave those in the pan when adding the eggs.
Use pork belly. The "bacon" here in the UK is too lean.|Use less of it though. The recipe was too greasy. Maybe use "smoked lardons"?
