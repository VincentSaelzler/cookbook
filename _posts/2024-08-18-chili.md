## NEXT TIME

try one liter of liquid when cooking the beans (instead of 2)

put in all the seasoning at the time of cooking the beans

cook the beans/meat mixture longer and the peppers and red onions less. they are still mushy

a bit more salt (to taste - check at end) with a TOTAL of 3 tsp it was not enough

just cooking beans only: they were done after 25 min pressue and 15 min wait plus 15 min pressure 0 min wait.
