Fresh and fantastic.

## Sautee

✅ Liberal Olive Oil  
🔪 350g (3 Small) Red Onion  
🔪 900g (6 Medium) Sweet Peppers  
🔪 500g (3 medium) Courgettes  
✅ 1 Cube (4 Cloves) Frozen Crushed Garlic  
✅ 250g Turkey Thigh Mince  

## Simmer

Add enough water right at the beginning to fully cover everything. The couscous will soak up a decent amount of water. Later on, keep topping up the water, but be more careful because eventually the vegetables will release their own water.

✅ 300 Whole Wheat Couscous  
✅ 2x 28g Vegetable Bullion Pot  
✅ 400g Can Chopped Tomatoes  
🌡️ 1.2 Liters Water to start, then add as necessary.  

## Season

✅ 2x packages (20g?) Chives  
✅ 30g package fresh curly parsley  
✅ 1 package fresh basil  
🔪 200g Feta  
✅ Salt to Taste (Took a lot)  
✅ Pepper to Taste (Took a lot)

## Output

➡️ 4.5 Liters

Freezing: Not ideal. The water separated out.
