# Secrets to Success
Still working on it...

## Next Time
Tried the low-and-slow method as described in the [BBQ Pork Ribs]({% post_url 2023-10-12-bbq-pork-ribs %}) recipe. The result was **dry**.

Freezing the meat first and then using the meat slicer before baking worked okay from a taste perspective.

However, it came out more shredded than sliced. It also seemed more difficult to get the meats slicer to work as desired. Furthermore, it prevents ever having the option of med-well meat. It was pretty good, but came out more like a philly cheese steak.

The shredded beef that was uncovered actually was a bit better. The one covered in silicone during baking was really wet with liquid when put on a sandwich.
