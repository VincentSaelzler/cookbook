2 sliced bacon, diced
1 small sweet onion, diced
1 bell pepper, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
1/4 TO 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chili powder
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons BBQ sauce
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon dijon mustard
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 (22 ounce) cans baked beans (I love Bush’s Grillin’ Beans for this recipe)
2 slices bacon, for topping (optional)


Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Heat a large (oven safe, if you don’t want to transfer) skillet over medium-low heat and add the bacon. Cook until it’s brown and crisp and most of the fat is rendered.

Stit in the onion, pepper and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until everything softens, about 5 minutes. Stir in the paprika, chili powder, salt and pepper. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, BBQ sauce, ketchup, mustard and brown sugar until combined.
Stir in the baked beans directly from the can. Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn off the heat. I suggest tasting the beans here and adding more salt, pepper or heat if desired. If you'd like, you can lay a few strips of bacon on top of the beans here too!
Place the skillet (or transfer to an oven-safe dish) in the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until bubbly and syrup. Remove and let cool slightly before serving.
You can make these ahead of time - cook them in the skillet then let cook to room temperature and cover, placing in the fridge. Bake the next day (or whenever you’re ready!).
These also freeze well!
