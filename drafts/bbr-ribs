3 hours of smoking. Prepare and preheat your smoker to 225 degrees, using the wood chips of your choice (be sure to make note of the section above where I talk about wood choices. Trim any messy flaps from ribs, and remove the silver skin membrane. Pat ribs dry to remove any excess moisture. Prepare and mix your rib rub, coat ribs in rub well, and let come to room temperature. Place the ribs on the smoker and smoke for 3 hours.
2 hours - smoked, while wrapped. Arrange large sheets of foil to wrap the ribs in. Add the ribs flesh side down, then cover with the cider, and butter mixture. Wrap the ribs tightly in foil and return to the smoker to smoke for another 2 hours. This step can be done in your oven (if you run out of wood chips, mess up timing, etc.)
1 hour - Finish, with sauce. Remove the ribs from the foil and paint on the BBQ sauce (if desired). Return to the smoker until crunchy and set in - around 15 - 20 minutes. If you like very crunchy BBQ sauce bark, you can repeat this step every 15 minutes or so for this last hour of cook time. This step can also be done in your oven (if you run out of wood chips, mess up timing, etc).
