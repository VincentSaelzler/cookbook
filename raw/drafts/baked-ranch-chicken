Chicken – I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. You can also use chicken thighs.
Seasoning – You’ll need ranch dressing mix for this! You can use my recipe, or buy a packet from the grocery store.
Breadcrumbs – I used seasoned breadcrumbs but you can also use regular run-of-the-mill breadcrumb or Panko breadcrumbs.
Parmesan Cheese – I like a nice freshly grated parm, it really makes a difference. Whatever you have on hand will work.
Mayonnaise – This mayo, you could say is my secret ingredient, it’s what tenderizes the chicken and makes nice and juicy. Use your favorite or make your own using my homemade mayonnaise recipe!

Preheat Oven: Preheat the oven to 375°F. Spray a 9×13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Prep Dredge: In a shallow plate, combine the ranch dressing mix with the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese. Place the mayo in another shallow plate.
Coat Chicken: Dredge the chicken breasts first through mayo on both sides, then through the breadcrumb mixture. Place into the prepared baking dish.
Bake: Transfer the baking dish to the preheated oven and bake for 40 minutes or until a thermometer reads 165°F when inserted into the thickest part of the chicken breast.
